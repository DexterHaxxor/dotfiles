# DexterHaxxor's dotfiles
I usually use Linux and macOS, so my configuration is focused mostly on that.

Recommended method for managing dotfiles is having the repository in `~/.dotfiles` and then using GNU Stow to symlink configurations for individual pieces of software.

Waybar configuration is loosely based on https://gitlab.com/Xylight/dotfiles/-/tree/main/

Linux configs:
- Hyprland
- Rofi
- Waybar

Cross-platform configs:
- Neovim
- Kitty
- Cargo

Abandoned configs:
- Emacs
- Alacritty
